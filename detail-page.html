                        <p class="my-4">Apple and Google are huddling over a potential deal to bring the search kingâs  Gemini            generative AI offerings to the iPhone.

                            The negotiations, first reported by Bloomberg on Monday, aim to let Apple license Geminiâs set of AI models to drive some new features for the iPhone later this year.
                            
                            While a deal would give Gemini a key edge with billions of potential users, Bloomberg noted, it also may be a sign that Apple isnât as far along with its AI efforts as some might have hoped.
                            
                            âApple appears to be behind its competitors in addressing generative AI, and this is partly because the pace of innovation has been so high that the timings of its yearly developer conference in summer and product release in autumn have created a mismatch at the current pace in the AI race,â said Paul Schell, an industry analyst with global technology intelligence firm ABI Research.
                            
                            Thatâs not to say Apple hasnât been busy developing its AI chops. âBehind the scenes, Apple has been busy developing its on-device generative AI capabilities and acquiring companies that will help it advance that technology â most recently with the acquisition of DarwinAI,â Schell told TechNewsWorld.
                            
                            âApple also has a Machine Learning Research division devoted to advancing its capabilities in the area, and Tim Cook has talked up generative AI in anticipation of iOS 18,â he added.

                            Part of Overall AI Strategy
                            âApple is way behind on AI,â declared Rob Enderle, president and principal analyst with the Enderle Group, an advisory services firm in Bend, Ore.

                            âThatâs kind of amazing,â he told TechNewsWorld, âsince Siri was one of the first digital assistants in the market, but once they launched it, they seemed to lose interest, which is why they are so far behind.â

                            A deal with Google could mesh with Appleâs overall AI strategy, noted William Kerwin, an equity analyst with Morningstar Research Services in Chicago.

                            âApple has taken a slow approach to any announcements around generative AI, which we see as its normal strategy,â he told TechNewsWorld. âApple has always been a premium follower to markets, never focusing on being first but focusing on putting out superior products.â

                            âWe havenât expected Apple to develop a proprietary generative AI model to license out, but focus on how to integrate generative AI into its products,â he said. âThis could be small Apple-built models living on edge, or larger cloud-based models.â

                             âA potential licensing agreement with Google Gemini would align with this â outsourcing the model itself but focusing on integrating it into products like Siri.â

                             Beneficial to Apple and Google
                            Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies, a technology advisory firm in San Jose, Calif., pointed out that Apple has been using AI in products since they introduced the Knowledge Navigator in 1987. AI is key to both Siri and Maps, he added, and Apple has home-grown technology to deliver AI-based apps and solutions.

                            âHowever, to deliver in-depth generative AI architecture on their own is expensive, and those base AI architectures are already built and can be licensed,â he told TechNewsWorld.

                             âEven if Apple had its own Gemini-level model, it probably would not have the infrastructure to serve its massive base of customers,â he explained. âIt is highly plausible that Apple could license a base generative AI architecture from another company and build even deeper and more Apple-specific products on that AI engine.â

                            A Gemini licensing deal could be beneficial to both Apple and Google.

                            âLicensing Gemini would enable Apple to make up considerable lost time in its own lagging AI development efforts,â said Charles King, the principal analyst at Pund-IT, a technology advisory firm in Hayward, Calif.

                             In addition, he told TechNewsWorld, âBy using a vetted third-party technology to train its AI systems, Apple will be able to preserve its well-deserved rep for honoring customersâ privacy.â

                             Rise of On-Device AI
                             âA lot of the AI models out there now require cloud access, so thereâs a lot of concerns about divulging private information,â added Ross Rubin, the principal analyst at Reticle Research, a consumer technology advisory firm in New York City.

                             âGoogle has a flavor of Gemini â Gemini Nano â that may appeal to Apple because it can run locally,â he told TechNewsWorld. âThatâs one way to preserve privacy and have the benefits of generative AI.â

                            ABIâs Schell pointed out that Google is ahead of the pack with its Gemini family of models, which have already been deployed to run entirely on some of its Pixel phones, as well as on certain Samsung Galaxy devices. âBy partnering with Google, Apple would be able to offer a relatively mature generative AI model to its customers on some or all of its devices,â he said.

                            âAll major chipset vendors and OEMs are pivoting towards on-device generative AI as its productivity-enhancing data privacy value proposition is very convincing, and this is particularly relevant given Appleâs legacy in data privacy leadership,â he added.

                            âAs such,â he continued, âI expect a host of significant announcements around on-device generative AI at this yearâs WWDC applying to Appleâs PC, tablet, and smartphone offerings.â Appleâs WWDC â World Wide Developers Conference â usually occurs in June.

                             Boon to Apple Users
                            Apple users could benefit from a Gemini licensing deal because it integrates Googleâs advanced search algorithms into their ecosystem, thereby enriching search functionality, maintained Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research in San Jose, Calif.

                             âIt promotes interoperability, enabling seamless integration between Appleâs ecosystem and Google services and fostering convenience for users,â he told TechNewsWorld, âand it could potentially reduce development costs and time-to-market for Apple, as it could utilize Googleâs proven technology instead of building a similar capability from scratch.â

                             âIt would obviously provide Apple with a host of capabilities it doesnât seem to currently own, and Google would get revenue and a marquee licensing partner,â Greg Sterling, co-founder of Near Media, a news, commentary and analysis website, told TechNewsWorld.

                             How much revenue Google â which pays Apple billions a year to be the Safari web browserâs default search engine â would get from a licensing deal is an intriguing question.

                            âThere may not be any licensing money,â Rubin suggested. âGoogle pays Apple for the privilege of running search on Appleâs platforms. The payment that Google gets is access to anonymized data for iPhone users, which gives them a holistic view of what people are doing on mobile. Maybe Google would be willing to offer their technology for free for the benefit of continuing to update their AI engine.â

                            Apple and Google did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

                        <p class="my-4">Last week was Nvidiaâs GTC, which I think should be renamed since we connect the âGâ in GTC to GPU, and this event was mainly about AI. If you are interested in AI, you should watch the keynote from the event. It was fricken amazing! The Disney robots stole the show! I was there, and even though the venue sucked, I still place it as one of the most amazing events Iâve ever experienced in line with the Windows 95 launch. Other CEOs should use this keynote as the new standard for how these things should be done.

                            After the event, we spent time with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. One of the things he repeated was that the decisions he made to make Nvidiaâs leadership in AI happen were insane.
                            
                            Had he been an executive at any other company, heâd have likely been fired long before this effort was successful because, until generative AI took off, one thing that any other companyâs CEO would have said was that Huang was nuts. He wasnât, and now Nvidia is the worldâs third most valuable tech company and challenging for number one.
                            
                            Weâll close with my Product of the Week. You canât buy it yet, but youâll be able to experience it at Disneyland and Disney World. Iâm talking about Disney BDX robots. Iâm glad we canât buy one, as Iâd be in line right now waiting to get mine.
                            
                            The Definition of Insanity Is Wrong
                            This has bugged me for a while. We typically define insanity as âdoing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.â That isnât insanity so much as it is considered stupidity. If you see someone doing something that hurts them and then doing it again, you donât call them insane. You call them stupid. When you repeat a mistake youâve made or observed, you didnât learn the lesson. If learning is smart, not learning is stupid, not insane.
                            
                            If conventional knowledge says that flying faster than the speed of sound will kill you, then flying faster than the speed of sound is insane. If people believe the world is flat, trying to circumnavigate it would be insane. If everyone believes that going to the moon is impossible, spending millions to do it is insane.
                            
                            So, you could argue that everyone from Christopher Columbus to Nikola Tesla was insane (well, Tesla more than most), though Iâd argue that those who drive the biggest change in our world are all insane â but in a good way. They donât agree that what they are doing is impossible and execute to a level that when they are done, what we think of as impossible has changed.
                            
                            What Nvidiaâs CEO Jensen Huang has done with the Blackwell GPU and Hopper CPU is pure insanity and incredibly brilliant, placing Nvidia at the point of the AI spear.
                            
                            The God Mode GPU
                            One of my favorite movies on Hulu is called âBoss Modeâ. But if youâre a gamer, it likely should have been called God Mode. This is when you adjust the game settings so that you cannot lose, and it is a fun way to get through the story quickly without a lot of the skill, puzzle, or sequence learning that otherwise would be required.
                            
                            With Blackwell and Hopper, Nvidia has created the God Mode GPU solution. Just looking at what is already a big GPU is misleading because what truly makes this a God Mode GPU is that you will eventually be able to network a theoretically unlimited number of these things together, creating GPUs of unlimited size and capability.
                            
                            The eight years it took to develop this solution resulted in a potential 1,000 times increase in performance. This achievement challenges Mooreâs law benchmark, which has defined the tech industry to date, equating to a 100-fold increase every decade.
                            
                            Granted, right now, there are limits tied to the copper being used for much of the networking, but Nvidia is working to eliminate these limits with more advanced technology, suggesting it wonât be long until these limits are pushed. To make this work, every GPU is connected all the time to every other GPU, resulting in thousands of cables with a total length measuring miles in one rack.
                            
                            It is interesting to note that supercomputers may not be that much faster, but theyâll use a fraction of the power to accomplish the same results in the same amount of time. The example provided was a prior system with 8K GPUs that would take 90 days and use 15 megawatts of power for a large project. A new system based on Blackwell would require 2K GPUs for the same 90 days and use only 4 megawatts. More would be faster but require more power (no free lunch here).
                            
                            As Huang would typically say, the more you buy, the more you save, and potentially, the faster you can get things done.
                            
                            Apple, Dell, Microsoft, Siemens
                            Four Nvidia partners were called out as leading their peers. Interestingly, the only client device shown throughout Huangâs keynote was not a PC from other vendors. It was Appleâs Vision Pro, arguing that it has the potential to be the new Apple II, foreshadowing the coming wave of true AI PCs, not the AI PCs weâve been told to expect.
                            
                            This perspective makes a certain amount of sense in that the PC is based on the world as it existed in the 1970s when Xerox PARC conceived it and thought it was stupid. Then Apple built it successfully, and then Microsoft/IBM/Intel took it and made it even more successful (which is both sad and funny).
                            
                            Jensen referred to the new interface as the âHuman Interface,â and I expect it will eventually replace the GUI, much like PCs replaced terminals, with the Apple Vision Pro being the current bar. Interestingly, while Steve Jobs was willing to correctly sacrifice the iPod to create the even more successful iPhone, Tim Cook isnât Steve Jobs. He hasnât yet made a similar decision, so itâs possible that Apple may miss this opportunity even though it has the chance to own it.
                            
                            Even though I think Lenovo has a better AI solution, it wasnât at the event. However, Michael Dell was, so it was Dell that got called out by Huang as having the best solution even though Michael Dell never made it to the stage. Iâd suggest you look at both the Dell and Lenovo solutions and make up your own mind. But I think Dell won this round. Thatâs interesting because, typically, Lenovo outplays Dell at events like this.
                            
                            When talking about cloud providers, Microsoft stood above the rest in its rapid embrace of Blackwell, working on a full duplicate of Nvidiaâs implementation. Microsoftâs run to implement AI has been impressive, catching everyone by surprise. Recently, Microsoft hired executive staff from Inflection to run the AI effort, a move that emulated prior strategies with Xbox and the Cloud. I remain impressed with Microsoftâs execution here.
                            
                            AWS and Google are playing too, but AWS is limited by its retail nature (it just doesnât push envelopes like this), and Alphabet (Google) still canât seem to focus, so itâs lagging behind Microsoftâs efforts. Given who and what AWS is, this is fine, but Alphabet needs more focused and dynamic leadership because it should have beaten Microsoft but was left in the dust instead.
                            
                            Siemens got a lot of coverage for applied AI. I used to work for Siemens, and itâs impressive on large-scale projects and showcases the path that stumbling companies like Boeing should emulate to dig out of their poor-quality mess (any flight that lands with most of the parts still on the plane is a good one). Siemens is an example of how to use AI to build critical projects better, faster, with high quality, and cheaper, making it an excellent example of how most firms should implement AI, placing the company as the clear AI leader in its powerful class.
                            
                            Computing vs. Generating
                            One of the things we will need to wrap our minds around is the difference between computing and generating.
                            
                            Current computers do what we direct them to do, whether that be word processing, spreadsheets, or graphics. With AI, computers generate outcomes based on commands. Instead of having to write a document, the computer does that when you tell it what you want. If you want to analyze something, you tell the computer to analyze it; you donât populate a spreadsheet. If you want a drawing, describe it and have the computer improve it.
                            
                            The user skill set is quite different. Office skills arenât useful with AI, nor are skills with Acrobat. Even programming skills arenât useful any more than knowing how to use a mechanical typewriter or calculator, which was useful after PCs became a thing. What is useful is command of the language and the ability to express your needs with complete, detailed concepts that the AI can then follow to create what you intend.
                            
                            Interestingly, building up AI skills may also help us become better communicators. But the people who will do best in this new world are those who are naturally better at communicating, not those who learn specific applications.
                            
                            Wrapping Up: Where AI Should Be Initially Focused
                            I remain concerned that we are initially focusing AI on the wrong people, like the folks toward the bottom of a company or organization, rather than those at the top. What I mean is that if anyone in the rank and file of a company makes a mistake, itâs generally survivable, but if a CEO makes the same level of mistake, it can kill a company. In the military, the commander can lose the war while the soldier may lose their life. So, the most significant positive impact of AI assistance exists at the top, not the bottom, yet that is not where we are focused.
                            
                            The other area is a concept Toyota produced years ago regarding autonomous driving called Guardian Angel. In a car, this technology prevents you from doing something stupid like driving too fast, running a stop light, or otherwise needlessly putting your life and the lives of your passengers at risk (it seems like every week I read a story about an impaired or distracted driver killing a family as a result of stupidity).
                            
                            Guardian Angel could be applied to life. If more of us had AIs that could help us make better decisions, weâd all be more affluent, less injured, have better relationships, and lead far happier and less unfortunately dramatic lives.
                            
                            Back to insanity. Ultimately, what Jensen Huang attempted with this new AI push would have been considered insane at any tech company Iâve ever worked for or with. Heâd have been fired, demoted, forced out, lambasted, criticized, and, depending on his approach, even locked up for misuse of company resources. But the result will and is changing the world. We need to change the world to enable people with vision to do what may seem insane to create what earlier generations might have called magic.
                            
                            Huang and Nvidia have created a God Mode GPU. The word âmagicâ is inadequate to describe it. We need more CEOs like Jensen Huang.

                                            <p class="mb-0">As is typically the case when one company jumps ahead of the others, analysts like me get asked what makes Nvidia so much more successful than its peers. While my peers may have different answers, I think there is one predominant cause for this success: Nvidiaâs CEO, Jensen Huang.

                                                Huang has had three clear advantages that most other CEOs lack. First, Huangâs technical proficiency allows him to set and execute a vision. Second, Huang is a founder, which typically grants unusual loyalty and power over the company. Finally, he is the longest-serving tech CEO in recent history.
                                                
                                                I say ârecent historyâ because Nvidia is around 30 years old, and IBMâs first CEO and founder, Thomas Watson, served for 42 years during a time when IBM pretty much was the tech industry and was even more successful than Nvidia is now.
                                                
                                                Thomas Watson had the same three advantages as Huang. When Watsonâs son, Thomas Watson, Jr., took over, he inherited those same advantages and took IBM to even greater levels by being additive. Huang has a son, Spencer, who works at Nvidia, but his true heir is AI, suggesting it could be either his or Spencerâs successor. Letâs talk about that this week.

                                            <h3>The DOJâs Flabby Antitrust Lawsuit Against Apple</h3>
                                            <p class="mb-0">CEOs are overcompensated, and this creates significant financial and operational problems in both public and private companies. CEOs werenât always the highest-paid positions.

                                                When I first entered the tech field, one of my jobs was managing compensation, and some of our sales reps made significantly more than the founding CEO. Granted, founders had founder stock, which eventually raised the CEOâs compensation when that stock was sold. But unlike today, CEO compensation wasnât massively higher than that of other executives. Todayâs CEOs are overcompensated, and that leads to three big problems:
                                                
                                                The disparity creates friction among employees who feel they are doing the work while the CEO gets all the rewards. This situation is particularly problematic when a CEO institutes a layoff or salary reduction plan, and the employees feel they are being treated unfairly, given the CEO, even with salary cuts, is making crazy money. This reduces loyalty to the CEO, making the company less efficient and key employees less likely to remain with the company.
                                                The CEO is motivated to acquire things that, in turn, need to be managed, detracting from doing the job they are paid to do. Some CEOs have multiple mansions, yachts, and rare car collections that are all enviable, but these things have to be managed and take away time from the CEOâs ability to do the job they were hired for. This additionally exacerbates the feeling in the rank and file that the CEO is taking advantage of them, particularly when cutbacks occur.
                                                This overcompensation can convey a feeling that the CEO can do whatever they want. They are so used to having crazy money and extreme authority that they get the idea that rules donât apply to them and discover the hard way that some rules do. CEOs getting fired for misogyny, mishandling of company assets, and other types of misbehavior are common and very disruptive to the company.
                                                The Advantage Enjoyed by Founders
                                                Successful founders tend to prioritize the company and often arenât known for excessive spending. This doesnât mean they donât sometimes spend excessively (Bill Gates did build a hotel of a house and then regretted it), but their possessions donât significantly degrade their focus on their company and people.
                                                
                                                So, while I do think excessive compensation degrades their performance, it doesnât seem to do so in a material way because their job and hobby are both the company and their true passion, and thus, they are able to outperform their more compensation-based peers.
                                                
                                                Founders also know the company more intimately because they directed its construction. They know better than anyone what the company is capable of and can better set an achievable vision for the firmâs future. Hired CEOs may never truly understand what a firm is capable of and avoid âthe vision thingâ altogether because they donât want to be seen as failures.
                                                
                                                The Succession Problem With Founders
                                                When a founder leaves, a company seems to lose its way. I was one of the folks who studied IBMâs decline and near collapse, and it was clear that when Thomas Watson Jr. left, IBM started to die. Interestingly, it didnât start to die when Thomas Watson Sr. left because Jr. effectively took his fatherâs advantages and enhanced them, as heâd been groomed to do that.
                                                
                                                Still, even though Iâd argue IBM has the best internal CEO training program and deepest bench of potential CEOs than any other company, it had to go outside that structure once, reset, and then rebuild because this âfounderâ capability was lost in transition.
                                                
                                                Corporations are supposed to be eternal, though Founder CEOs donât always want them to be because they donât want to be overshadowed by their successor. Watson Sr. was one of the exceptions since he, as most fathers should, seemed to want his son to be even more successful than he was.
                                                
                                                Succession just doesnât seem to be a priority in most firms. Most CEOs seem more worried that their successor will be selected prematurely â and for good reason, because that often happens, which conflicts with a good succession process.
